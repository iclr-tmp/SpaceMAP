# SpaceMAP

This repo is the implementation of SpaceMAP for the ICLR 2022 submission: 'SpaceMAP: Visualizing Any Data in 2-dimension by Space Expansion' 

SpaceMAP IS a novel dimensionality reduction method based on space geometry and hierarchical manifold approximation.💫

It can handle both clustered and continuous datasets with both local and global structure preserved.🍀

## Key Features

SpaceMAP holds two ideas: 
1. Space geometry is all you need (to map any data in any dimension).
2. Datasets are mostly hierarchical and lie on manifolds with different scales.

## Embedding Results
